# CV Generator


[Demo](https://stevenwalker91.github.io/cv-generator/)

This was my first React project as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The objective was to make a CV generator using class components in React.

I had a number of challenges in this project but I learnt a lot. In hindsight, I would have structured the components differently so that the sidebar components mirror how the main section components work and are stored in state. The code also isn't optimal as I discovered different ways to do things as I worked through the project.

All in all, it was a great challenge and I look forward to moving on to functional components.
